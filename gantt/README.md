# Gantt chart viewer

You can see the gantt chart of real simulation result.
This chart using *d3.js* library. 
You can see the chart by opening *gantt.html* file using your web browser.
I recommend you to use *Google-Chrome* web browser.

You have to add *--allow-file-access-from-files* option if you use *Google-Chrome* browser.
You can find the timestamp file name in the *gantt.html* file 
and you can change visualizing configuration by changing the constant values at the *gantt.html*.
